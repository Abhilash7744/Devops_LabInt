Step 1: Create Your Project Files
First, you need to create a folder for your project and add your three essential files: app.py, requirements.txt, and Dockerfile.

Create a project folder:

Bash

mkdir myapp
cd myapp
(All the following files must be created inside this myapp folder.)

Create the Python App (app.py): This is a minimal web application using the Flask framework.

Python

# This is the corrected order of the code [cite: 15, 16, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23]
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def home():
    return "Hello from Dockerized Flask app!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=5000)


Create the Requirements File (requirements.txt): This file tells Python which packages to install.



flask


Create the Dockerfile: This text file instructs Docker how to build your image. name it as Dockerfile



# Start from the official Python 3.9 (slim) base image [cite: 30]
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set the working directory inside the container to /app [cite: 31]
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the requirements file into the /app directory [cite: 37]
COPY requirements.txt .

# Run pip to install the packages from requirements.txt [cite: 38]
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the rest of your project (e.g., app.py) into the /app directory [cite: 39]
COPY . .

# Tell Docker that the container will listen on port 5000 [cite: 40]
EXPOSE 5000

# Define the default command to run when the container starts [cite: 41]
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
At this point, your myapp folder should contain these three files.

Step 2: Build the Docker Image


Run the docker build command:
docker build -t flask-docker-sample .


Step 3: Run the Docker Container


Run the docker run command:
docker run -p 5000:5000 flask-docker-sample
